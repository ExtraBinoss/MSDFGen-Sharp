# Test Fonts

This directory contains three different types of fonts used for testing purposes to demonstrate the library's capabilities:

*   **Roboto-Regular**: A standard, modern sans-serif font.
*   **ComicSansMS3**: A casual script font.
*   **Barbarian**: A "fantaisist" (decorative/fantasy) font, included to prove that the library can handle diverse and complex styles.
